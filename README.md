# Markup (An automated answer sheet evaluation System)

## Project Overview
The **Markup Project** is an AI-driven solution designed to automate the process of answer sheet evaluation in educational settings. It is built to improve accuracy and efficiency in grading by using advanced machine learning techniques for handwritten recognition, figure detection, and answer comparison. The project is divided into three main modules: Pixelparse, GraphoMind, and Riddlers, each handling specific tasks within the assessment pipeline.

## Key Features
- **Automated Answer Sheet Digitization**: Converts both digital and handwritten answer sheets into a structured digital format for easier processing.
- **Question Extraction and Figure Analysis**: Extracts questions from question papers and identifies if figures are required in responses.
- **Handwritten Answer Recognition**: Uses OCR and neural network models to digitize and interpret handwritten responses with high accuracy.
- **Dynamic Marking System**: Automatically compares student answers with the answer key, scoring responses based on content accuracy and relevance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes an intuitive front-end for educators to easily interact with the system and access grading results.

## Modules
1. **Pixelparse**: Responsible for detecting, extracting, and comparing figures within the answer sheets and question papers.
2. **GraphoMind**: Focuses on question extraction, figure requirement analysis, handwritten answer recognition, and marking system development.
3. **Riddlers**: Creates answer keys from source documents, detects answers in the sheets, and performs answer comparison against the key.
